<h1>13 History and acknowledgments</h1>

<p>The name "Ipe" is older than the program itself.  When I made
figures for my papers using Idraw in 1992, I was annoyed that I had to
store two versions of each figure: one with Latex text, one with
Postscript information.  I came up with a file format that I called
"Ipe", for "Integrated Picture Environment", and which was at the
same time legal Latex source code and a legal Postscript file.
<p>When I wrote the first version of Ipe at Utrecht University in the
summer of 1993, it created this file format directly, and inherited
the name.  The first versions of Ipe (Ipe&nbsp;2.0 up to&nbsp;4.1) were based on
my experiences with Idraw, XFig, and Jean-Pierre Merlet's JPDraw, used
IRIS-GL and Mark Overmars' FORMS library, and run on SGI workstations
only.
<p>Due to popular demand, I spent two weeks in the summer of&nbsp;1994 to
teach myself Motif and to rewrite Ipe to run under the X&nbsp;window
system.  Unfortunately, two weeks were really not enough, and the 1994
X-version of Ipe was somewhat of a hack.  I didn't have time to port
the code that displayed bitmaps on the screen, it crashed on both
monochrome and truecolor (24-bit) displays, and was in general quite
unmaintainable.
<p>These versions of Ipe were supported by the Netherlands' Organization
for Scientific Research&nbsp;(NWO), and I would never have started working
on it without Geert-Jan Giezeman's PLAGEO&nbsp;library.  For testing,
support, and inspiration in that original period, I'm grateful to Mark
de Berg, Maarten Pennings, Jules Vleugels, Vincenzo Ferrucci, and Anil
Rao.  Many students of the department at Utrecht University served as
alpha-testers (who apparently referred to Ipe as "the cute little
core-dumper").
<p>I gave a presentation about Ipe at the Dagstuhl Workshop on
Computational Geometry in 1995, and made a poster presentation at the
ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry in Vancouver in the same year.
Both served to create a small but faithful community of Ipe addicts
within the Computational Geometry community.
<p>Ipe proved itself invaluable to me over the years, especially when we
used it to make all the illustrations in our book "Computational
Geometry: Theory and Applications" (Springer 1997, with Mark de Berg,
Marc van Kreveld, and Mark Overmars).  Nevertheless, the problems were
undeniable: It was hard to compile Ipe on other C++ compilers and it
only worked on 8-bit displays.  It was only due to the efforts of Ipe
fans such as Tycho Strijk, Robert-Paul Berretty, Alexander Wolff, and
Sariel Har-Peled that the 1994 version of Ipe continued to be used
until&nbsp;2003.
<p>I was teaching myself C++ while writing the first version of Ipe, and
it showed&mdash;Ipe&nbsp;5 was full of elementary object-oriented design
mistakes.  When teaching C++ to second-year students at Postech in
1996 I started to think about a clean rewrite of Ipe.  My first notes
on such a rewrite stem from evenings spent at a hotel in Machida,
close to IBM Tokyo in July&nbsp;1996 (the idea at that time was to embed
Ipe into Emacs!).  It proved impossible, though, to do a full rewrite
next to teaching and research, and nothing really happened until the
Dagstuhl Workshop on Computational Geometry in&nbsp;2001, where Christian
Knauer explained to me how to use Pdflatex to create presentations. I
realized that PDF was ideally suited for a new version of Ipe. 
<p>Ipe&nbsp;5 figures were at the same time Latex and Postscript files, and
required special handling to be included into Latex documents, which
sometimes required a bit of explaining when talking to co-authors or
publishers.  While editing a figure, Ipe&nbsp;5 kept a Ghostscript window
open that would show what the figure looked like after processing by
Latex.  
<p>Several developments that had happened between 1993 and 2001 allowed me
to use a completely new approach: First, H&agrave;n Th&ecirc; Th&agrave;n's Pdflatex takes Latex
source and directly produces a PDF file with a PDF representation of
the text and all necessary fonts.  Second, Derek Noonburg's&nbsp;Xpdf
contained an open-source PDF parser that I could use to parse this PDF
representation and to extract the processed text and fonts.  Third,
all relevant Latex fonts are now available as scalable Type1 fonts,
and so it is possible to embed Latex text and formulas in figures that
may still need to be scaled later.  Finally, the Ghostscript window
was no longer necessary as Ipe could use the beautiful Freetype
library to directly display the text on-screen as it will appear on
paper. 
<p>Directly after the Dagstuhl workshop I implemented a proof-of-concept:
I defined the Ipe XML format (there was no question that Ipe&nbsp;6 would
have to be able to communicate in XML, of course), wrote "ipe5toxml"
(reusing my old Ipe parsing code) and a program that runs Pdflatex,
parses its PDF output, extracts text objects and font data, and
creates a PDF file for the whole Ipe figure.
<p>All that remained to be done was to rewrite the user interface.  Mark
de Berg and the TU Eindhoven made it possible for me to take some time
off from teaching and research.  The final design changes were made
during the Second McGill-INRIA Workshop on Computational Geometry in
Computer Graphics at McGill's Bellairs Research Institute in February
2003, and much inspiration was due to the atmosphere at the workshop
and the magnificient cooking by Gwen, Bellair's chef.  An early
preview of Ipe&nbsp;6.0 was "formally" released at the Dagstuhl Workshop
on Computational Geometry in March&nbsp;2003, to celebrate the Dagstuhl
influence on Ipe.
<p>Other than the file format, there weren't really that many changes to
Ipe's functionality between Ipe&nbsp;5 and Ipe&nbsp;6.  Ren&eacute; van Oostrum
insisted that no self-respecting drawing program can do without style
sheets and layers.  Views allow you to incrementally build up a page
in a PDF presentation. 
<p>I also revised the interface to ipelets (which used to be called
"Iums" in the good old days when people still thought that
"applets" were small apples)&mdash;it is now based on dynamically loaded
libraries (a technology that was still somewhat poorly understood in
the early nineties, at least by me).  
<p>And, of course, there was a Windows version of Ipe&nbsp;6.  Who would have
thought that ten years earlier!
<p>There were many releases of Ipe&nbsp;6.0, all of them called "previews",
because I never considered that I had reached a stable state.  A
number of experimental features were tried and either built into Ipe
or discarded.  Ipe&nbsp;6 migrated from Qt&nbsp;2 and Qt&nbsp;3 to Qt&nbsp;4, a somewhat
painful process due to a number of annyoing Qt&nbsp;bugs that cost me a lot
of time. 
<p>When in 2007 I discovered the fantastic Cairo library for rendering, I
immediately decided to switch Ipe to use this: a small dedicated
library with a nice API to do the rendering, instead of the buggy
monster that was&nbsp;Qt.  The Cairo API fit Ipe so well that I could write
a Cairo painter for Ipe in an hour or so.  Cairo supports Freetype
directly, instead of Ipe having to render each glyph into a bitmap
that is then blit onto the canvas. 
<p>I made the huge mistake of announcing on the Ipe discussion list that
Ipe&nbsp;6.0 preview&nbsp;28 was the last version of Ipe&nbsp;6, and that there would
soon be a new version, Ipe&nbsp;7.  I should have known that this was
impossible during a time where I advised several graduate students,
taught several new courses, and went through the tenure process.  
I had to release several bugfix releases of Ipe&nbsp;6 while really wanting
to work on Ipe&nbsp;7.
<p>However, the delay left me with enough time to carefully think about
another change I wanted to make: It would be nice if Ipe embedded a
scripting language that could be used to write simple ipelets without
compilation.  I looked at Scheme/Guile, Python, and Lua, and finally
decided for Lua: a small, elegant, stable language with a tiny
footprint, easily embedded with a very nice C interface.
<p>In 2009, I had my first sabbatical ever, which I spent in the group of
Ulrik Brandes at the University of Konstanz.  Here I finally had the
time to work on Ipe&nbsp;7, and I'm very grateful to Ulrik and all members
of his group for the wonderful time I had in Konstanz.  Next to the
two big changes mentioned above, Ipe&nbsp;7 introduced tiling patterns,
gradients, clipping paths, transparency, user-definable arrows and
marks, and SVG output.
<p>I wanted to avoid Qt in Ipe&nbsp;7 as it had caused me quite a bit of pain
during the life of Ipe&nbsp;6, but it was hard to find a good replacement
that would allow Ipe to run on Linux, Windows, and Macs.  During the
Korean Workshop on Computational Geometry organized by Tetsuo Asano at
Hakusan seminar house in June&nbsp;2009, I discussed using Ipe on tablet
PCs with Vida Dujmovic, Jit Bose, and Stefan Langerman.  It is their
fault that Ipe&nbsp;7 comes with a tablet input tool, and finally Stefan
and S&eacute;bastien Collette convinced me that there isn't really an
alternative to Qt that has the same support for tablets and Macs.  So
Ipe&nbsp;7 is still using Qt, but in a much more restricted way than
before, and hopefully much less sensitive to bugs in Qt.
