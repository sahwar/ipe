<h2>4.1 Path objects</h2>


Path objects are defined by a set of <span class="tex-emph">subpaths</span>, that is, curves
in the plane.  Each subpath is either open or closed, and consists of
straight line segments, circular or elliptic arc segments, parabola
segments (or, equivalently, quadratic B&eacute;zier splines), cubic B&eacute;zier splines, and cubic B-spline segments.  The curves are drawn with the
stroke color, dash style, and line width; the interior of the object
specified is filled using the fill color.
<p>The distinction between open and closed subpaths is meaningful for
stroking only, for filling any open subpath is implicitely closed.
Stroking a set of subpaths is identical to stroking them individually.
This is not true for filling: using several subpaths, one can
construct objects with holes, and more complicated pattern.  The
filling algorithm is normally the <span class="tex-emph">even-odd rule</span> of
Postscript/PDF: To determine whether a point lies inside the filled
shape, draw a ray from that point in any direction, and count the
number of path segments that cross the ray.  If this number is odd,
the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.
<p>Ipe can draw arrows on the first and last segment of a path object,
but only if that segment is part of an open subpath.
<p>There are several Ipe modes that create path objects in different
ways.  All modes create an object consisting of a single subpath only.
To make more complicated path objects, such as objects with holes, you
create each boundary component separately, then select them all and
use the <span class="tex-emph">Compose paths</span> function in the <span class="tex-emph">Edit</span> menu.  The
reverse operation is <span class="tex-emph">Decompose path</span>, you find it in the context
menu of a path object that has several subpaths.
<p>You can also create complicated paths by joining curves sequentially.
For this to work, the endpoint of one path must be (nearly) identical
to the begin point of the next&mdash;easy to achieve using snapping.  You
select the path objects you wish to join, and call <span class="tex-emph">Join paths</span>
in the <span class="tex-emph">Edit</span> menu.  You can also join several open path objects
into a single closed path this way.
<p><span id="id1">  
Circles</span> can be entered in three different ways.  To create an ellipse,
create a circle and stretch and rotate it.  Circular arcs can be
entered by clicking three points on the arc or by clicking the center
of the supporting circle as well as the begin and end vertex of the
arc. They can be filled in Postscript fashion, and can have
arrows. You can stretch a circular arc to create an elliptic arc.
<p>A common application for arcs is to mark angles in drawings. The snap
keys are useful to create such arcs: set arc creation to <span class="tex-emph">center
&#38; 2 pts</span>, select <span class="tex-emph">snap to vertex</span> and <span class="tex-emph">snap to boundary</span>,
click first on the center point of the angle (which is magnetic) and
click then on the two bounding lines.
<p><span id="id2">







There</span> are two modes for creating more complex general path objects.
The difference between <span class="tex-emph">line</span> mode and <span class="tex-emph">polygon</span> mode is
that the first creates an open path, the latter generates a closed
one.  As a consequence, the <span class="tex-emph">line</span> mode uses the current arrow
settings, while the <span class="tex-emph">polygon</span> mode doesn't.
The path object created using line or polygon mode consists of
segments of various types.  The initial setting is to create straight
segments. By holding the shift-key when pressing the left mouse button
one can switch to uniform B-splines. One can also add quadratic
B&eacute;zier spline segments, cubic B&eacute;zier spline segments, and circular
arc segments as follows:
<p>To add a quadratic B&eacute;zier spline (that is, a parabola), click twice
in polyline mode for the first two control points.  Then press the
<font color="#0000ff">q</font> key and click on the third (last) control point.
<p>Similarly, to add a cubic B&eacute;zier spline, click three times in
polyline mode on the first three control points.  Press the <font color="#0000ff">c</font>
key, and click on the last control point.
<p>Circular arcs can be added as follows: Click twice in polyline mode,
once on the starting point of the arc, then on a point in the correct
tangent direction.  Press the <font color="#0000ff">a</font> key, and click on the endpoint
of the arc.
<p>To make curves where segments of different type are joined with
identical tangents, you can press the <font color="#0000ff">y</font> key whenever you are
starting a new segment: this will set the coordinate system centered
at the starting point of the segment, and aligned with the tangent to
the previous segment. 
<p>For the mathematically inclined, a more precise description of the
segments that can appear on a subpath follows.  More details can be
found in Foley et al.<sup><a href="manual_53.html#id2">2</a></sup> and other text books on splines.
<p>A subpath consists of a sequence of segments.  Each segment is either
a straight line segment, an elliptic arc, a quadratic B&eacute;zier spline,
a cubic B&eacute;zier spline, or a uniform cubic B-spline. 
<p>The quadratic B&eacute;zier spline defined by control points <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>,
<i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, and <i>p<sub>2</sub></i>, is the curve
<div class="tex-math"><i>
P(t) = (1-t)<sup>2</sup> p<sub>0</sub> + 2t(1-t) p<sub>1</sub> + t<sup>2</sup> p<sub>2</sub>,
</i></div>
where&nbsp;<i>t</i> ranges from <i>0</i> to <i>1</i>. This implies that it starts in
<i>p<sub>0</sub></i> tangent to the line <i>p<sub>0</sub>p<sub>1</sub></i>, ends in <i>p<sub>2</sub></i> tangent to
the line <i>p<sub>1</sub>p<sub>2</sub></i>, and is contained in the convex hull of the
three points.  Any segment of any parabola can be expressed as a
quadratic B&eacute;zier spline.
<p>For instance, the piece of the unit parabola <i>y = x<sup>2</sup></i> between <i>x=a</i>
and <i>x=b</i> can be created with the control points
<blockquote><table border><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>
p<sub>0</sub> </td><td colspan="1" align="center"> = </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> (a, a<sup>2</sup>)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
p<sub>1</sub> </td><td colspan="1" align="center"> = </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> ( (a + b)/(2), ab) </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
p<sub>2</sub> </td><td colspan="1" align="center"> = </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> (b, b<sup>2</sup>)
</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>
Any piece of any parabola can be created by applying some affine
transformation to these points.
<p>The cubic B&eacute;zier spline with control points <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>,
 <i>p<sub>2</sub></i>, and <i>p<sub>3</sub></i> is the curve
<div class="tex-math"><i>
R(t) = (1-t)<sup>3</sup>p<sub>0</sub> + 3t(1-t)<sup>2</sup> p<sub>1</sub> + 
3 t<sup>2</sup>(1-t) p<sub>2</sub> + t<sup>3</sup> p<sub>3</sub>.
</i></div>
It starts in <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> being tangent to the line <i>p<sub>0</sub>p<sub>1</sub></i>, ends in
<i>p<sub>3</sub></i> being tangent to the line <i>p<sub>2</sub>p<sub>3</sub></i>, and lies in the convex
hull of the four control points.
<p>Uniform cubic B-splines approximate a series of <i>m+1</i> control points
<i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, &hellip;, <i>p<sub>m</sub></i>, <i>m  &ge; 3</i>, with a curve consisting
of <i>m-2</i> cubic polynomial curve segments <i>s<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>s<sub>1</sub></i>, &hellip;,
<i>s<sub>m-3</sub></i>. Every such curve segment is defined by four of the control
points. In fact, curve segment <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> is defined by the points
<i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>i+1</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>i+2</sub></i>, and <i>p<sub>i+3</sub></i>. If the curve is closed
(a <span class="tex-emph">splinegon</span>), it contains three additional curve segments
<i>s<sub>m-2</sub></i>, <i>s<sub>m-1</sub></i>, and <i>s<sub>m</sub></i>, defined by appending <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>,
<i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, and <i>p<sub>2</sub></i> to the end of the sequence.  A uniform B-spline
segment on an open subpath of an Ipe path object is defined by
repeating both the first and last control point three times, so as to
make the segment begin and end in these points.
<p>The segment <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> is the cubic curve segment with the following
parametrization.
<div class="tex-math"><i>
Q(t) = ((1-t)<sup>3</sup>)/(6) p<sub>i</sub> + (3t<sup>3</sup> -6t<sup>2</sup> + 4)/(6) p<sub>i+1</sub>
+ (-3t<sup>3</sup> + 3t<sup>2</sup> + 3t +1)/(6) p<sub>i+2</sub> + (t<sup>3</sup>)/(6)
p<sub>i+3</sub>,
</i></div>
where <i>t</i> ranges from <i>0</i> to <i>1</i>.
<p>Since the point <i>Q(t)</i> is a convex combination of the four control
points, the curve segment <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> lies in the convex hull of <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> to
<i>p<sub>i+3</sub></i>. Furthermore, it follows that any affine transformation can be
applied to the curve by applying it to the control points.
Note that a control point <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> has influence on only four curve
segments, <i>s<sub>i-3</sub></i>, <i>s<sub>i-2</sub></i>, <i>s<sub>i-1</sub></i>, and <i>s<sub>i</sub></i>. Thus, when you
edit a spline object and move a control point, only a short piece of the
spline in the neighborhood of the control point will move.
